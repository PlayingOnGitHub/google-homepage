Created with HTML/CSS
---------------------

I am creating this project to demonstrate that I can adequately create a page that appears very similar to Google's home page. This page will help me to better understand HTML and CSS, since I will be putting my skills into practice. This page will also show me what I have learned so far. I created this project per The Odin Project's curriculum.
